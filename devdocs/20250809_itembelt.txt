Managing the item belt was another hard problem in the previous iteration

The fact that item belt size is potentially affected by equipment is a 
complicating factor.  Will copy-paste code from previous iteration, and
make adjustments as necessary.

There's a situation to address: What happens when the belt size shrinks while
there's still items in the item belt?
answer: put them in the inventory

	-idea 1: write a function in GameCharacter that reclaims excess items
		HOW IS THIS HANDLED?
			-connect signal "item_belt_changed" to function "manage_item_belt"
	-idea 2: write a function in CharacterManagement that does the same thing
