The proper implementation of special abilities requires an ability class, and
an associated dictionary, abilityDB, which holds the static properties of 
each special ability.  	

WHY?

Programatically, the *GameCharacter* class should be responsible for deducting
the cost of activating it's own abilities.  However, as it stands, the 
abilities script has a lot of functions added to perform this functionality.

So, to keep the content organized, it is handled in this way.

CAN THE ACTUAL CODE FOR THE EFFECTS AND EXECUTION OF THE ABILITY BE INCLUDED
IN THIS DATABASE/DICTIONARY?

I don't see at this time how that's possible; it's just going to be one giant
switch case in the meantime to handle the code for every ability that's 
activated.

Disregard all that. Kludged in MP consumption into Abilities.gd as it's currently
written.  Next task:
	-Creating abilities for opponents
	-coaxing them into using their abilities/items
