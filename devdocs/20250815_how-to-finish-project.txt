Before I move on to some other project, I want to at least accomplish this
for this game: 
	-A scenario with 5 "levels"
		first 4 levels are options of battles to choose from (randomized each game?)
		
	-After level 1:
		-Player receives rewards in the form of xp / gp
		-player receives some kind of item
		
	-After level 2:
		-player chooses an ability to unlock
		
	-After level 3:
		-Player receives rewards in the form of xp / gp
		-player receives some kind of item
		
	-After level 4:
		-player chooses an ability to unlock
		
	-- AT LEVEL 5 --
	
		-player attempts to beat the boss
		
	WHAT TO DO WITH XP?
	
		-Each stat can be leveled up with additional XP, dark souls style
		
		something like your overall character level
