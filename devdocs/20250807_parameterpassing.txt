TODAY'S PROBLEM TO SOLVE: PROPER PARAMETER PASSING

steps to achieve goal:

	-re-implement char select ui
		RECALL: The entire project began to break down once an attempt at 
		pulling description data from gamecharacter class in char select
		menu didn't work.  So:
			-re-implement description data in gamecharacter database entries
			themselves
			-re-attempt to pull the data into the menu
	
	-re-implement char management ui
	-pass proper character data from char select to char management ui
	-re-implement battle ui
	-pass proper data from char management and scenario db into battle ui
	-re-implement abilities.gd and items.gd

...
had to stop almost immediately

--11:30--
have some time, working on carefully importing scripts and classes from 
old project iteration ui fights 2

-- 12;48 --
Need to stop for now.  When back: need to decide how to handle character 
inventory and item gain/removal.


--23:01--
inventory and item gain/removal appears to be handled for now.

current problem: dynamic update of UI elements using signals

WHAT I'VE LEARNED

-Implement signals within GameCharacter
-set GameCharacter to emit "this variable has changed" signals whenever changes
to variables occur
-connect those signals to custom functions within the UIs that use those values

This is the most elegant solution
