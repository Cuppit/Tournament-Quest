A drastic change was made: stats as an enum was moved to Global instead of 
inside of GameCharacter.  This is because the way stats are set up, the other
classes (weapon, armor, etc.) need equal access to those properties.

Fixed a bug with the "gain_item" method where it would fail to gain anything
that wasn't a regular item (e.g. weapons, armor, etc.).  also finished 
fixing all the classes to use the new system of stat mod tracking 
(e.g. a dictionary for all possible stats instead of flat properties such as
 "damage bonus").

TODO
	-Finish Character Management UI
		-armor + accessory buttons, functions, signal setups, etc.
		-Item slot management
		-debate whether to re-implement some things (like the pop-up window
		 that appears when mousing over equipment, explaining their stats)
