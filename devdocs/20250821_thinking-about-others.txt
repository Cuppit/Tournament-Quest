The game has two  problems:
	-it's ugly
	-it's not fun'
	
For a game like this, the majority of the fun comes from seeing and understanding
choices and options, and seeing the immediate result of those choices.

For example, there's a ton of polish needed for the character management 
screen, such that a player can instantly see why a loadout is good, or what
impact something will have.

It's also not fun to fight because the UI sucks.  There needs to be clear
visual indicators of what's going on, not a dry report in a log at the 
bottom of the screen.

So: let the UI be the UI, and give an actual presentation, with kinematic bodies,
and animations.  

IDEA: make a generic character rig

.  At this point this is turning into
almost exactly a Sonny clone.
